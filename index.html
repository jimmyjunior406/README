        <h1>How to Play</h1>
          <p>There's 2:00 minutes left on the clock. You're down four points. No Time-Outs left. Ball is in your hand. Go win the game!!</p>
          <p>If you think you can run the ball, go for it. But, becareful. If the other team chooses a run defense, you could fumble the ball.</p>
          <p>If you think a couple short passes could do the trick, it could land you a pass up to 25 yards! Watch out for intereptions if the other team chooses correctly.</p>
          <p>Or... Air it out. Choosing a long pass is more difficult to catch, interceptions are easier, but the reward could be up to 40 yards down field!</p>
